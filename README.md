# Blog

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.10.

------------------------------

This project was an assigment to build a simple blog in Angular. The aim was to create a blog where there the user can create, edit and delete blogs. Create posts in the blogs and do the same and add comments to the blogs.

There is also a few tests in some components where for example a mock-service adds data to an observer and check if it's the right name and that an object is in the array that receives it.

This was my first project built in Angular. Hopefully you enjoy it :D!
